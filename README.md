## Building and Running
From the root directory, run "lein repl" and then execute the function (-main)

Note that due to poor design the game will not run well on slower hardware in its current state.


###Additional Notes
The faces used for the ghosts are of consenting coworkers / friends. I wasn't taking out my frustrations on them.
