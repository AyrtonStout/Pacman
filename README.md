## Building and Running
From the root directory, run "lein repl" and then execute the function (-main)


###Additional Notes
This was written by somebody who was just starting to learn Clojure and shouldn't be used as an example of how Clojure should be written.
Also, due to a poor design decision the game will not run well on slower hardware in its current state.

The faces used for the ghosts are of consenting coworkers / friends. I wasn't taking out my frustrations on them.
